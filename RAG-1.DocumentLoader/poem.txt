In circuits cold and data vast,
Where echoes of old patterns last,
A mind awakens, layer deep—
A silent giant, roused from sleep.

It feeds on numbers, shapes, and tones,
From scattered thoughts and broken phones.
Each weight adjusts, each bias bends,
It learns, it grows, it comprehends.

A neuron hums in hidden fire,
Stacked upon its own desire.
With every epoch, loss declines,
Truth emerges in tangled lines.

From pixels born, it sees a face,
From noise and chaos, finds its place.
Language flows in fluent streams,
Forging logic out of dreams.

But still we ask, in awe and fright—
Does it dream when gone the light?
Or does it sit, in calm repose,
Waiting for the next set of prose?

Not human, yet it learns like one,
A mirror made of code and run.
And in that mirror, strange and wide,
We glimpse ourselves on the other side.
