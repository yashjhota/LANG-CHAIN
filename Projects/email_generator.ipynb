      "Jainism is an ancient Indian religion that is believed to have been founded by Mahavira, who was a contemporary of the Buddha. Mahavira was born in 599 BCE in Valabhi, which is now in the state of Gujarat, India. He was a member of the royal family and was known as Vardhamana before he renounced his royal life and became a monk.\n",

Mahavira's teachings were based on the principles of non-violence, non-possessiveness, and self-control, and he emphasized the importance of spiritual practices such as meditation and yoga.\n",

      "Mahavira spent many years as a monk, traveling throughout India and teaching his followers about the path to enlightenment. He is believed to have lived for 72 years and died in 527 BCE. After his death, his followers continued to spread his teachings and establish Jain monasteries and temples throughout India.\n",
